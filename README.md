Android Sliding Up Panel
=========================

The 2.2 version of the [Umano](http://umanoapp.com) [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sothree.umano) features a sexy sliding up draggable panel for the currently playing article. This type of a panel is a common pattern also used in the Google Music app and the Rdio app. This is an open source implementation of this component that you are free to take advantage of in your apps. Umano Team <3 Open Source.

### Usage

To use the layout, simply include `com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout` as the Root element in your activity Layout. Layout must have `gravity` set to either `top` or `bottom`. Make sure that it has two children. The first child is your main layout. The second child is your layout for the sliding up panel. The main layout should have the width and the height set to `match_parent`. The sliding layout should have the width set to `match_parent` and the height set to either `match_parent` or the max desireable height. For more information, please refer to the sample code.
```xml
<com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout
    xmlns:sothree="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:id="@+id/sliding_layout"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:gravity="bottom"
    sothree:panelHeight="68dp"
    sothree:shadowHeight="4dp">

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:gravity="center"
        android:text="Main Content"
        android:textSize="16sp" />

    <TextView
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:gravity="center|top"
        android:text="The Awesome Sliding Up Panel"
        android:textSize="16sp" />
</com.sothree.slidinguppanel.SlidingUpPanelLayout>
```
For smooth interaction with the ActionBar, make sure that `windowActionBarOverlay` is set to `true` in your styles:
```xml
<style name="AppTheme">
    <item name="android:windowActionBarOverlay">true</item>
</style>
However, in this case you would likely want to add a top margin to your main layout of `?android:attr/actionBarSize`.
```
### Additional Features and Customization

You can restrict the drag area of the sliding panel to a specific view by using the `setDragView` method or `dragView` attribute. Otherwise, the whole panel will be slideable and it will intercept all clicks.

You can change the panel height by using the `setPanelHeight` method or `panelHeight` attribute.

If you would like to hide the shadow above the sliding panel, set `shadowHeight` attribute to 0.

You can disable sliding by using `setSlidingEnabled` method. This can be useful if you want to show\hide panel only from the code. By default sliding is enabled.

You can add paralax to the main view by setting `paralaxOffset` attribute (see demo for the example). 

You can set a anchor point in the middle of the screen using `setAnchorPoint` to allow an intermediate expanded state for the panel (similar to Google Maps).

You can set a `PanelSlideListener` to monitor events about sliding panes.

You can also make the panel slide from the top by changing the `layout_gravity` attribute of the layout to `top`.

By default, the panel pushes up the main content. You can make it overlay the main content by using `setOverlayed` method or `overlay` attribute. This is useful if you would like to make the sliding layout semi-transparent.

### Implementation

This code is heavily based on the opened-sourced [SlidingPaneLayout](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/widget/SlidingPaneLayout.html) component from the r13 of the Android Support Library. Thanks Android team!

### Requirements

Tested on Android 2.2+

If you are using Android studio, make sure to add the following section to the root `build.gradle` file:

```
allprojects {

  buildscript {
    repositories {
